# SnomBot Public Release
### Note
This is the public version of SnomBot, wich will be adapted for all servers soon. You can help me developing it if you want, just DM on Discord (Mr. Gradient#8873) or send me an e-mail (thedjplays.gaming@gmail.com).

## What is SnomBot?
SnomBot is a Discord bot inspired by the Pok√©mon itself from the Sword and Shield series. I initialy started this project for School, but it went too far and now I want it to be on all Discord servers haha.

## Invite the bot
A link will be provided soon, I haven't linked the bot to the Discord API yet.
